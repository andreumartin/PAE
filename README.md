## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer & Technical Details

This project is just a **prototype**. For this reason, we cannot guarantee perfect functionality in all possible scenarios.

The front-end is built using **Vue.js**, along with **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**.

Since this is an early prototype, the **back-end integration** and **database connection** are not included in this version.  
Future versions could simply connect to a back-end service and a database to enable full data persistence.  
This release is intended as a basic, functional **demonstration prototype** only.
